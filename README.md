# Hermitcraft's coords for online maps

This repository contains the markers files used in Hermitcraft's [map renders](https://hermitcraftmaps.confusion.pt/).

## Add or edit coordinates and icons

1. Fork this repository

2. Edit respective markers.js file. The formart is the following `{"pos" : [X, Z, Y(if unknown set to 64)], "title" : "Marker Title Here", "icon" : "poi.png", "iconSize" : [24, 24]},`.
Default icon is `poi.png`, there are more icons available in icons folder and you can add more with 24x24 resolution. Markers are also divided by categories, if you want to rearrange those you can, just keep the file organized.

3. After the changes are done **make a pull request**.
I will verify the requests manually just to prevent abuse. After the approval they will be applied to the respective map.
*At this stage you can add your reddit username to the pull request comments to be displayed instead of the github username in the "Thanks to" list on the index page of the maps.*

**Note: Don't forget to make the pull request, otherwise the changes will not be applied to the map.**  
Here is a [little video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk7hJuQrZKE) that might help you using github (Fork, edit, commit and pull request).
